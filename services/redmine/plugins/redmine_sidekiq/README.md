Redmine Sidekiq
===============

Background jobs will use the [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) on Redmine.
You can Monitoring easily used by [Sidekiq plugin](http://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_sidekiq).

## Features

* Administrator can use the Sidekiq Web UI from the top menu.
* Add to autoload_paths of the Plugin `/app/workers`.
* IMPORTANT: Anyone trying to use the sidekiq `:delay` method, use `:sidekiq_delay` instead because for former has clashes with Redmine safe attributes. There is NO change for `:delay_for` and `:delay_until` methods.
