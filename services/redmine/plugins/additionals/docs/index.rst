Developer features
------------------

As Redmine does not support asset pipeline, we need to install Javascript plugins as Redmine plugins to load them globally.

If no common files are used as library plugin, every plugin has to deliver the same files. And if more
than one version of a library is delivered with each Redmine plugin, there is a problem.

Therefore if developer uses this plugin for the provided libraries, everything works smoothly.
Don't worry, if you only need a subset of the provided libraries. If you do not load a library, it is not used.

It provides :

* `bootstrap-datepicker 1.8.0 <https://github.com/uxsolutions/bootstrap-datepicker>`_
* `d3 3.5.17 <https://d3js.org/>`_
* `d3plus v2.0.0-alpha.17 <https://d3plus.org/>`_
* `jQuery TagIt 2.0 <http://aehlke.github.io/tag-it/>`_
* `FontAwesome 5.2.0 <https://fontawesome.com/>`_
* `mermaid 8.0.0-rc8 <https://github.com/knsv/mermaid/>`_
* `nvd3 1.8.6 <https://github.com/novus/nvd3>`_
* `ZeroClipboard 2.3.0 <https://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboard>`_

And a set of various Rails helper methods (see below).

It provides the following Rails helper methods :

Libraries assets loader
-----------------------

.. code-block:: ruby

  additionals_library_load(module_name)


This method loads all JS and CSS files needed by the required module.

The following modules are available :

* d3
* d3plus
* mermaid
* nvd3
* font_awesome
* notify
* tag_it
* zeroclipboard
